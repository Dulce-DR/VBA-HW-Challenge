# VBA-HW-Challenge
I worked with going over the homework with my fellow student Vanessa Mock, we walked through the formulas and made sure that we both got similar answers to the homework. 
I used many of the in class videos that were recorded from UofU bootcamp to help with the formulas. That is where all of my formulas came from, were with in the vidoes and the class assignnmets that were provided. 
I also verified that I used the correct formulas with Chat.openAI.com it helped double check my work.
I also used BCS to help me submit my homework and to write the Readme. 
None of the formulas are my own, nor do I claim them as my own. They are all provided the in class activities and with in the class recordinds I was a part of.
